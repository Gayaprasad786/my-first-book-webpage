            Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar' (रामधारी सिंह 'दिनकर')was an Indian Hindi poet, essayist and academic,
            who is considered as one of the most important modern Hindi poets. He remerged as a poet of
            rebellion as a consequence of his nationalist poetry written in the days before Indian independence.
            His poetry exuded veer rasa, and he has been hailed as a Rashtrakavi ("National poet") on account of
            his inspiring patriotic compositions.As a mark of respect for him, his portrait was unveiled in the
            Central Hall of Parliament of India by the Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh on his centenary
            year, 2008.

            Rashmirathi (Rashmi: Light (rays) Rathi: One who is riding a chariot (not the charioteer)) is a Hindi
            epic written in 1952, by the Hindi poet Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar'.The work is centered around the life
            of Karna, who was son of unmarried queen Kunti (Pandava's mother) in the epic- Mahabharata.Karna was the
            first-born son of Kunti, whom she had abandoned at birth as he was conceived before Kunti's marriage.He
            was born by the blessing of Surya Dev(The Sun).Karna grew up in a lowly family of charioteers, yet became
            one of the best warriors of his time. In the Great Mahabharata war, Karna was obliged to fight from the side
            of Duryodhana as Duryodhana, recognizing his merits, had made him a king and adopted him as a close friend.
            Karna fighting from Kaurava's side was a great worry for Pandavas as he was reputed to be unconquerable in
            war.
            The way Dinkar has presented the story of Karna with all hues of human emotions trapped in moral dilemmas is
            simply marvelous. The rhythm and meter are lilting. Choice of words and purity of language is exhilarating.

            The epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War in the Mahabharata narrates the conflict between the two warring
            sides, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, for the throne of Hastinapura. Spanning across 18 days, the
            Kurukshetra
            War involved many ancient kingdoms who participated in the war. In his book, Kurukshetra (Hindi), Ramdhari
            Singh Dinkar pens his thoughts on this royal battle.Written in the aftermath of the Second World War,
            Kurukshetra
            (Hindi) is a narrative poem based on the Shanti Parva found in the Mahabharata. It reflects Dinkar’s idea of
            war
            and peace and captures the heroic India. In Kurukshetra (Hindi), he points out that war leads to
            destruction,
            but is also necessary for the protection of one’s freedom.Kurukshetra condemns war, but also illustrates the
            importance of power. Power is needed not only for winning but also for forgiving. Dinkar notes that
            kindness,
            forgiveness, sacrifice, and tolerance are worthy if we have power, otherwise they are a sign of cowardice.
            Dinkar analyses the justification and need for war. The book includes dialogues between Bhishma and
            Yudhisthira
            reflecting on the repercussions of war, and Yudhisthira repenting for his unfair actions.Since it was first
            published in 1946, Dinkar’s Kurukshetra (Hindi) has remained a favourite among readers.

            had
            the idea for Harry Potter while delayed on a train travelling from Manchester to London King’s Cross in
            1990. Over
            the next five years, she began to plan out the seven books of the series. She wrote mostly in longhand and
            amassed a

            Krishna Dvaipāyana, also known as Vyasa (Sanskrit: व्यासः) and Veda Vyāsa (वेदव्यासः, Veda-vyāsaḥ, "the one
            who classified
            the Vedas"), is a rishi (sage). He is best known as the traditional author of the Mahabharata, one of the
            two most
            important epics of Hinduism. He is also credited as the traditional compiler of the Vedas, as well as the
            writer of
            other important works including the Puranas.As per the Mahabharata, Vyasa is the son of rishi Parashara and
            a fisherwoman
            named Kali (Satyavati), who later marries king Shantanu of Kuru. Throughout the epic, Vyasa appears
            occasionally helping
            the Kuru kingdom. His spiritual career includes compiling many texts and spreading the knowledge through his
            disciples.The
            festival of Guru Purnima is dedicated to him. It is also known as Vyasa Purnima, the day believed to be both
            of his birth
            and when he divided the Vedas. Vyasa is considered one of the seven Chiranjivis (long-lived, or immortals),

            in existence according to Hindu tradition.

            The Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit: भगवद् गीता, "The Song of God"),often referred to as the Gita, is a 700-verse
            Hindu scripture
            that is part of the epic Mahabharata (chapters 23–40 of Bhishma Parva), dated to the second century BCE. It
            is considered
            to be the primary holy scripture for Hinduism, the world's third largest religion.The Gita is set in a
            narrative framework
            of a dialogue between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer Krishna, an avatar of Lord Vishnu.
            At the start of
            the Dharma Yuddha (righteous war) between Pandavas and Kauravas, Arjuna is filled with moral dilemma and
            despair about the
            violence and death the war will cause in the battle against his own kin. He wonders if he should renounce
            and seeks Krishna's
            counsel, whose answers and discourse constitute the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna counsels Arjuna to "fulfill his
            Kshatriya (warrior)
            duty to uphold the Dharma" through "selfless action".The Krishna–Arjuna dialogues cover a broad range of
            spiritual topics,
            touching upon ethical dilemmas and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war Arjuna faces.

        <p>
            Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta , was an Indian Hindu monk. He
            was a chief disciple
            of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna.He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian
            philosophies of Vedanta and
            Yoga to the Western world,and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status
            of a major world
            religion during the late 19th century.He was a major force in the contemporary Hindu reform movements in
            India, and contributed
            to the concept of Indian nationalism as a tool to fight against the British empire in colonial
            India.Vivekananda founded the
            Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with the
            words "Sisters and
            brothers of America in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in
            1893.

            My Master is an English book combined from two lectures delivered by Swami Vivekananda in New York and
            England, published in 1901.
            In the lecture Vivekananda clearly told, if there was even a single word of truth, a single word of
            spirituality in his lectures
            he owed it to his Master — Ramakrishna, only the mistakes were his own.Vivekananda was against coloring the
            life and activities
            of Ramakrishna. My Master is the only book where Vivekananda told something about his master Ramakrishna.The
            book first published
            in 1901 in New York by The Baker and Taylor Company.The book contained an appended extract from a writing
            written by Protap Chunder
            Mozoomdar, published in Theistic Quarterly Review in October 1979.
